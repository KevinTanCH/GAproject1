GA Project 1 Turn-Based RPG by Kevin

## Turn-Based RPG

This is a turn-based RPG game. I wanted to make a simple turn-based RPG game using Javascript. As of now it is mainly text based. Items in the game are inspired by common game items and historical real world items. The monsters are inspired by Mythological creatures.
